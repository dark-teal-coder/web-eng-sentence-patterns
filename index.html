        <h1>B32. as if / as though</h1>
        <h2>Model</h2>
        <ol>
            a. She screamed hysterically as if / as though she had seen a ghost.
            b. He behaved as if / as though he were the owner of the house.
            c. She looks as if / as though she is going to cry.
        </ol> 
        <h2>Grammar</h2>
        <ol>
            1. As if and as though are conjunctions.
            2. They can only be put after the main clause.
            3. The clause after as if / as though can be in the present tense or the past tense.
        </ol>
        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <ol>
            1. The two expressions are used in the same way.
            2. After as if and as though, we often use the past tense with a present meaning to show that a comparison is 'unreal'.
            e.g. They are talking as if they were old friends. (But they don't know each other.)
        </ol>
